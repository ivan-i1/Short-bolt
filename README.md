Heroclix project piggybank
==========================
For each day that passes and I fail to work on the project:
100 Heroclix cash will be added as a penalty
Days worked will be counted here as commits
Days not worked will not have commits

At the end of a to-be-set period of time the commits will be counted against days from starting day
There will be a list in order of heroclix to be purchased
Each purchase will happen when the price is met
Penalty purchases will continue until the project is complete

Once the phase 1 of the project is complete, a free testing time will happen
Testing time will use heroclix as input and will result in a probability of one defeating the other
Missing interactions will be noted and listed for subsequent phases

Phases:
Phase 1: Close combat, no movement, no powers
Phase 2: Close combat, no movement, powers
Phase 3: Close combat, point-blank ranged combat, no movement, powers
Phase 4: Several pieces
